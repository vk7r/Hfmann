{- huffmanTree t
  iterates over all (key, value) pairs in t and adds them as HuffmanTrees into a PriorityQueue,
  merges the trees in the PriorityQueue in increasing order of priority into a single HuffmanTree.

  Merges the HuffmanTrees in q into one tree, in increasing order of priority
  If there is only one tree in q, that tree is returned, otherwise it merges the trees until there is only one.
  RETURNS: A merged tree consisting of all the trees in q
-}

{-hqmerge' q
  Helper function for hqmerge.
  Merges the two trees with least priority in q
